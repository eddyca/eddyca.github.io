Iâ€™m a Graphic Designer with an insatiable curiosity and a hunger for learning. I recently completed a front-end development course at General Assembly. Since then I have continued to immerse myself in code. I'm hooked! I daydream about stuffing my Subaru Outback full of all of my belongings and moving to the Pacific Northwest. I love to travel, trying new recipes, and getting my hands dirty gardening.
